# Landing Page

This is my landing page for my website. I made a second repo because I wanted to try things out without having to wait for jeykll to load each time and I don't want to worry about breaking things on mistake.

## Todo:

- [x] Get mountains setup in a way i like
- [x] Add stars and make them sparkle
- [x] Add vancouver city structure on right side
- [ ] Add moving cloud to vancouver
- [ ] make it rain when cloud goes over vancouver sometimes
- [x] Add title text names to mountains
- [ ] Make another animation for mobile instead of trying to make it work (It's just easier and gives me practice) use display: hidden and media queries
